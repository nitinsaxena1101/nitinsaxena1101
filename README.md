hi, i'm Nitin Saxena, passionate backend/ software engineer from india. My passion for software lies in making dreams and ideas come true with elegance. I take great care in the design, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

ðŸ’¬ ask me about anything, i am happy to help/ mentor :)
